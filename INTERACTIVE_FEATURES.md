- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for add, O(n) for search/delete/move
- **Benefits**: Efficient insertion/deletion, bidirectional traversal

### Stack (Play History)

- **Operations**: Push played songs, pop for undo
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for all operations
- **Benefits**: Natural LIFO behavior for undo functionality

### Binary Search Tree (Rating System)

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) average for lookup
- **Benefits**: Instant song retrieval by ID or title

### Deque (Recently Skipped Tracker)

- **Operations**: Add skipped songs, maintain circular buffer, view/clear history
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for add/remove operations
- **Benefits**: Efficient double-ended access, automatic memory management as circular buffer
- **Implementation**: Tracks last 10 skipped songs with FIFO behavior when full

### Auto-Replay HashMap (Play Count Tracking)

- **Operations**: Track play counts, identify frequently played songs, support replay decisions
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) average for count updates and lookups
- **Benefits**: Fast play count analytics, efficient replay queue management
- **Implementation**: Maps song IDs to play counts for intelligent auto-replay
